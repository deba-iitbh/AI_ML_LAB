# Twitter TinyBert

In this homework we will be training a tiny twitter sentiment classifier, which can be deployed in the mobile/embedded systems.

Fine-Tune the General [TinyBert](https://huggingface.co/huawei-noah/TinyBERT_General_4L_312D) model using the [Twitter Sentiment dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/carblacac/twitter-sentiment-analysis) using the two stage training procedure discussed in the class. Also, do use the data augmentation for the twitter dataset.

Please refer to the TinyBert Github [repo](https://github.com/yinmingjun/TinyBERT) for the model codes.
